## The tentative project title:

How is health insurance related to vaccination status for Hepatitis A
and B vaccines?

## The motivation for this project:

Vaccination has a major public health impact but is increasingly viewed
as controversial. Increasing rates of vaccination against hepatitis is a
key strategy for reducing incidence of this disease. The intended final
products: A linear regression model illustrating how vaccination status
changes relative to health insurance coverage.

## The anticipated data sources:

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a national
longitudinal program of studies, using data collected from 2017-2018.

## The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges:

We plan to use linear regression to calculate whether there is an
association between health insurance coverage and vaccination status for
hepatitis A and B. We will estimate the effect size and consider
p-values below 0.05 to be significant. We will control for potential
confounders, including age, sex, race, income, education, and hepatitis
history. The primary coding challenge will be cleaning the data and
determining the appropriate confounders.

## Planned timeline:

– Before proposal: decide the interested dataset

– After meeting with TA, divide up tasks and group meeting schedule

– Meet with TA when having issues

– Hold group meeting to follow up for 1 to 2 times per week

– Hold group meeting for project review after finishing
